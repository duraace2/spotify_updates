Various scripts to automatically create Spotify playlists

This idea was formed after feeling like Spotify "knew" me too well, and I wanted to be able to hear a more diversified music (that I more or less still liked).

While other scripts may be uploaded here, here are the current contents and purposes of the scripts:
  --spotify_update.py: Pulls in all the playlists on your profile, and then combines into one playlist
      Note: It's currently set to save the various songs to a playlist in my profile.  This will be fixed
