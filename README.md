Various scripts to automatically create Spotify playlists

This idea was formed after feeling like Spotify "knew" me too well, and I wanted to be able to hear a more diversified music (that I more or less still liked).

As a note up front, these scripts will look for the various logins, secrets, etc. in a file call "spotify_secrets.py" that's imported in with the objects in that referenced in the code.  This was not added to this respository.

While other scripts may be uploaded here, here are the current contents and purposes of the scripts:

  --spotify_update.py: Pulls in all the playlists on your profile, and then combines into one playlist
  
  


Note: It's currently set to save the various songs to a playlist in my profile.  This will be fixed
